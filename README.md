# The-Hanged-Man

This is a simple application based on plain html, css and javscript with some flavour of jquery.

#RULES:

The rules are simple. You type in password you think of (this should be some english or polish word(s)).
The another person tries to guess what the password is by choosing letters.
If the person manages to find out what password you typed in, she win.
If on the other hand she wont in 8 tries, you win.

The most important thing is not to play alone, because you will neither win or loose, falling in the limbo of not resolved games.
