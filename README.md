# Hangman

This is a simple application based on plain html, css and javscript with some flavour of jquery.

#RULES:

The rules are simple. You type in password you think of (this should be some english or polish word(s)).
The another person tries to guess what the password is by choosing letters.
If the person manages to find out what password you typed in, that person win.
Otherwise the man will be hanged
